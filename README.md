# Cord Game Engine

This is a game engine I made for fun. I'm not sure where I want to bring this but I think I did a good job on the design.

## How to build (the test application)

You'll need CMake and some build tools. If you're on Linux, you just need CMake, Makefile and GCC and then you can run:

```bash ./config.sh```

And then to build and run:

```bash ./run.sh```
